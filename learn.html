                The coffee plant, which was discovered in Ethiopia in the 11th Century, has a white blossom that smells like jasmine and a red, cherry-like fruit. Back then, the leaves of the so-called "magical fruit" were boiled in water and the resulting concoction was thought to have medicinal properties. As the fame of the coffee plant spread to other lands, its centuries-long voyage was about to begin.

                Another myth has it that the discovery of coffee berries (cherries) was made by an Ethiopian goat farmer named Kaldi. Legend has it that Kaldi became intrigued after he observed his goats becoming quite energetic and dancing around after eating the red fruit of the coffee shrub. He decided to try one of these magical berries and found that they made him more active as well!

                Today when we think of a coffee shop, we think of Starbucks. However, the coffee shops of the past were drastically different with their Middle Eastern culture. One thing they have in common is the social aspect, a place for discussion of new ideas.
                <br>
                The coffee house, which originated in the Middle East around 1511, began simply as a place to enjoy an exotic drink, coffee, but soon evolved into a place that helped change the course of history. Just as coffee houses spread all over Europe in the 17th century, they were also opened in America in the late 17th century.

                As coffee became more widely used and known, there arose many new inventions pertaining to the process of brewing coffee. So many, in fact, that there is a museum in London (the Bramah Museum of Tea & Coffee <a href="www.teaandcoffeemuseum.co.uk">www.teaandcoffeemuseum.co.uk</a>) that is filled with these devices. In Italy, for example, Luigi Bezzera filed a patent for a machine that pushed steam and water through a “group” that held the coffee grounds in a filter.

                    The tea story started in China around 2750 BC. During this time, the tea plant was found to have a number of medicinal properties. Legend says that an Emperor by the name of Shen Nung was sitting in the shade of a wild tea tree, boiling some drinking water, when a breeze blew a few leaves from the tree into the pot and gave the water a flavor that he found delicious. In the early days of tea consumption, the leaves were picked and boiled in water to produce a rather bitter brew. The leaves were used primarily as a medicine and secondly as a pleasurable drink.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Dutch were the first to drink tea in Europe, shipping it in 1610, with the introduction to Britain around 1650. It arrived a few years after coffee had reached England. It was through the coffeehouses that the new drink spread to the people. In 1657, Thomas Garway, an English proprietor, had the idea of offering tea to the public, and it quickly became the drink of choice, far outpacing wines and liquors.

                    In 1772, the tea tax was causing problems in Great Britain’s colonies in America. During the 19th century, however, tea drinking became an essential part of British social life. Tea parties and events were organized for all possible occasions, including family teas, picnic teas and elegant afternoon teas.

                    <br>
                    Over the years, housekeeping manuals and cookbooks gave clear instructions about teatime invitations, etiquette, methods of brewing and serving, dress and tableware. The tea party was the very symbol of elegance and prosperity.

                    Although the first tea was discovered in China, several other areas of the world now contribute to the overall tea harvest. The first tea used in England originated in China, and it wasn’t until the 19th century that tea growing spread to Formosa and that indigenous tea was discovered in Assam. In 1839, the first Indian tea was sold in London.
